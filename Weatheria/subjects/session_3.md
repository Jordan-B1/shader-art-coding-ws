# Session 3: Securing Access to Weather Stations with RFID Authentication  

## Objectives  
By the end of this session, you will have:  
- Integrated an RFID module to enable authentication using RFID badges.  
- Implemented a user management system with secure access controls.  
- Enhanced the backend to enforce role-based access control.  

---

## Project Steps  

### Part 1: Integrating the RFID Module  
1. **Introduction to RFID**  
   - What is RFID, and how does it work?  
   - Describe the components: RFID reader, badges, and their communication protocol.  
2. **Hardware Setup**  
   - Connect the RFID module to the Raspberry Pi (e.g., using GPIO pins).  
   - Verify the wiring and connections.  
3. **Reading RFID Tags**  
   - Write a Python script using a library like `MFRC522` to detect and read RFID badge IDs.  
   - Test the script to ensure it outputs badge IDs when scanned.

### Part 2: Implementing an Authentication System  
1. **Introduction to Authentication**  
   - What is authentication, and why is it important for securing the weather stations?  
2. **User Management**  
   - Design a simple user system that stores:  
     - Usernames  
     - RFID badge IDs  
     - Roles (e.g., Read-Only, Admin)  
   - Use a database (e.g., SQLite or your existing InfluxDB) to store user details securely.  
3. **Authentication Logic**  
   - Write a script that verifies if a scanned RFID badge ID exists in the user database.  
   - If the ID is valid, allow access. Otherwise, deny it.  

---

### Part 3: Integrating Authentication with the Backend  
1. **API Enhancement**  
   - Extend the backend API to include user authentication:  
     - Endpoint for authenticating users via their RFID badge ID.  
     - Return appropriate responses based on the user’s role.  
   - Example flow:  
     - RFID scans badge → Backend verifies badge ID → Backend returns user role and permissions.  
2. **Securing Backend Access**  
   - Add middleware to API endpoints to enforce access control based on user roles.  
   - Example: Only Admins can modify settings; Read-Only users can view data but not change it.  

---

### Part 4: Implementing Role-Based Access Control  
1. **Understanding Roles**  
   - Discuss the purpose of roles (e.g., separating Admin and Read-Only users).  
2. **Role Management in the API**  
   - Extend the user database schema to include roles.  
   - Adjust API routes to respect role-based permissions:  
     - Admin: Full access (read/write).  
     - Read-Only: Limited access (read-only).  
3. **Testing Role-Based Access**  
   - Create test users with different roles.  
   - Simulate API requests and ensure access is granted or denied based on the user’s role.  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
By the end of this session, you should have:  
1. An RFID-based authentication system for weather stations.  
2. A user management system with secure access control.  
3. A backend that enforces role-based permissions for API interactions.

## Tips  
- Test the RFID module thoroughly to ensure reliable reads.  
- Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid badge scans or unauthorized access attempts.  
- Use secure practices for storing and transmitting user credentials.
