# 🛠️ My Workshops – by Jordan BANKOLE

Welcome to this repository containing a set of technical workshops I created and led during my time as an Accompagnateur Pédagogique (APE) at [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu). These workshops aim to introduce students to modern, hands-on topics through progressive and engaging sessions.


## 📁 Contents

### 🎨 Shader Art (Folder: `Shader-art/`)
Learn how to write generative visuals and animations using GLSL fragment shaders. This workshop helps students explore the basics of GPU programming through creative exercises, including:

- Gradients and time-based animations
- Wave propagation effects
- Mouse interactions
- Freestyle shader art creation

Each session includes intuitive formulas, tips, and exploration ideas to foster both technical skills and artistic expression.

### 🌐 IoT Sensor Infrastructure (Folder: `Weatheria/`)
Build a full pipeline for gathering, processing, and visualizing real-time sensor data using Raspberry Pi boards. In this workshop, students:

- Create low-level drivers for sensors (I²C, SPI)
- Send data live to an InfluxDB time-series database
- Monitor metrics using a Grafana dashboard

This workshop includes practical hardware interaction and modern DevOps practices with Docker, MQTT, and REST APIs.
