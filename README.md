This is a workshop designed to introduce you to the basics of shader art programming


## What is shader art?
Shader art is a form of digital art that is created using computer programs called shaders. Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and are used to render graphics. Shaders are written in a language called GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and are used to control the appearance of 3D objects (or not) in real-time. Shader art is a unique form of digital art that allows artists to create stunning visual effects and animations using code.

## Pre-requisites
This is a beginner-friendly workshop, and no prior experience with shader programming is required. However, it is **highly** recommanded to take a look at this video before the workshop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY&t=906s
This is a great introduction to the basics of shader programming and will give you a good understanding of the concepts we will be covering in this workshop.

## What will you lean ?
In this workshop, you will learn the basics of shader programming and how to create stunning visual effects using code. You will learn how to write simple animations by controlling evey pixel on your screen. Decide the color depending on the position of the pixel and the timestamp. By the end of this workshop, you will have a good understanding of the basics of shader programming and will be able to create your own shader art.
